People have gathered data from applications and systems until today and now is the time to analyze them. The next steps are producing suggestions from the data and creating predictions about the future. [Here](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science) you can find the biggest question for **Data Science** and hundreds of answers from experts.\n\n\n| Link | Preview |\n| --- | --- |\n| [What is Data Science @ O'reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-data-science) | _Data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience, the willingness to build data products incrementally, the ability to explore, and the ability to iterate over a solution. They are inherently interdiscplinary. They can tackle all aspects of a problem, from initial data collection and data conditioning to drawing conclusions. They can think outside the box to come up with new ways to view the problem, or to work with very broadly defined problems: “here’s a lot of data, what can you make from it?”_ |\n| [What is Data Science @ Quora](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science) | Data Science is a combination of a number of aspects of Data such as Technology, Algorithm development, and data interference to study the data, analyse it, and find innovative solutions to difficult problems. Basically Data Science is all about Analysing data and driving for business growth by finding creative ways. |\n| [The sexiest job of 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) | _Data scientists today are akin to Wall Street “quants” of the 1980s and 1990s. In those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds, where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies. Then a variety of universities developed master’s programs in financial engineering, which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms. The pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers, whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs._ |\n| [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) | _Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data._ |\n| [How to Become a Data Scientist](https://www.mastersindatascience.org/careers/data-scientist/) | _Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations._ |\n| [a very short history of #datascience](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/) | _The story of how data scientists became sexy is mostly the story of the coupling of the mature discipline of statistics with a very young one--computer science.  The term “Data Science” has emerged only recently to specifically designate a new profession that is expected to make sense of the vast stores of big data. But making sense of data has a long history and has been discussed by scientists, statisticians, librarians, computer scientists and others for years. The following timeline traces the evolution of the term “Data Science” and its use, attempts to define it, and related terms._ |\n\n\n## Learn Data Science\n\nOur favorite programming language is _Python_ nowadays for #DataScience. Python's - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library has full functionality for collecting and analyzing data. We use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) to play with data and to create applications.\n\n- [Algorithms](#algorithms)\n- [Colleges](#colleges)\n- [MOOC's](#moocs)\n- [Podcasts](#podcasts)\n- [Books](#books)\n- [YouTube Videos & Channels](#youtube-videos--channels)\n- [Toolboxes - Environment](#toolboxes---environment)\n- [Journals, Publications and Magazines](#journals-publications-and-magazines)\n- [Presentations](#presentations)\n- [Tutorials](#tutorials)\n\n## Algorithms\n\nThese are some Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms and models help you to understand your data and derive meaning from it.\n\n### Supervised Learning\n\n- Regression\n- Linear Regression\n- Ordinary Least Squares\n- Logistic Regression\n- Stepwise Regression\n- Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines\n- Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing\n- Classification\n  - k-nearest neighbor\n  - Support Vector Machines\n  - Decision Trees\n  - ID3 algorithm\n  - C4.5 algorithm\n- Ensemble Learning\n- Boosting\n- Bagging\n- Random Forest\n- AdaBoost\n\n### Unsupervised Learning\n\n- Clustering\n  - Hierchical clustering\n  - k-means\n  - Fuzzy clustering\n  - Mixture models\n- Neural Networks\n- Self-organizing map\n- Adaptive resonance theory\n\n### Semi-Supervised Learning\n\n### Reinforcement Learning\n\n- Q Learning\n- SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) algorithm\n- Temporal difference learning\n\n### Data Mining Algorithms\n\n- C4.5\n- k-Means\n- SVM\n- Apriori\n- EM\n- PageRank\n- AdaBoost\n- kNN\n- Naive Bayes\n- CART\n\n## COLLEGES\n\n- [A list of colleges and universities offering degrees in data science.](https://github.com/ryanswanstrom/awesome-datascience-colleges)\n- [Data Science Degree @ Berkeley](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/)\n- [Data Science Degree @ UVA](https://dsi.virginia.edu/)\n- [Data Science Degree @ Wisconsin](http://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/)\n- [MS in Computer Information Systems @ Boston University](http://cisonline.bu.edu/)\n- [MS in Business Analytics @ ASU Online](http://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/graduate/master-science-business-analytics/)\n- [Data Science Engineer @ BTH](https://www.bth.se/nyheter/bth-startar-sveriges-forsta-civilingenjorsprogram-inom-data-science/)\n- [MS in Applied Data Science @ Syracuse](https://ischool.syr.edu/academics/graduate/masters-degrees/ms-in-applied-data-science/)\n- [M.S.
